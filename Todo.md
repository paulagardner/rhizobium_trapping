#Critical
- [x] change filepaths to reflect that 'workflow' files have been moved to the copied local repo on mesabi, 'rhizobium_trapping'
- [x] update methods to include both paula's and rebecca's ideas for how to approach data analysis 
- [x] make your own notes on the 2015 paper in time for postdoc meeting
- [ ] understand, then write in methods, exactly what popoolation2 is doing to the data. Make it more specific rather than less, we can always cut later
- [ ] research nmds vs rdn (?? can't remember other method) and take notes on costs vs. benefits of nonparametric methods

### Important
- [x] remove 'shell scripts' folder in github to reflect that it no longer exists in local mesabi repo
- [x] rebecca git tour
- [ ] edit filepaths so they are WITHIN repos so that they can work if downloaded to another computer (and don't have them be full filepaths)
- [ ] make a test plot from the R data 
- [ ] validate that workflow is functional from A -> Z (since around time of repo creation, files were reorganized)
  - [ ] sort.sh
  - [ ] make_bam_list.sh
  - [ ] create_mpileup.sh
  - [ ] bash sync.sh
  - [x] create_paired_fsts.R

##### Optional
- [x] move R scripts and rds data into appropriate folders
~~- [ ] rearrange files for reference genome to be in a more convenient directory (they are buried in informationally named folders due to the 'my reference is coded with a different ID because it's from a different source' issue~~ see 'important'
