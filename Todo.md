#Critical
- [x] change filepaths to reflect that 'workflow' files have been moved to the copied local repo on mesabi, 'rhizobium_trapping'
- [x] update methods to include both paula's and rebecca's ideas for how to approach data analysis 
- [ ] make your own notes on the 2015 paper in time for postdoc meeting
### Important
- [x] remove 'shell scripts' folder in github to reflect that it no longer exists in local mesabi repo
- [ ] make a test plot from the R data 
- [ ] validate that workflow is functional from A -> Z (since around time of repo creation, files were reorganized)

##### Optional
- [x] move R scripts and rds data into appropriate folders
- [ ] rearrange files for reference genome to be in a more convenient directory (they are buried in informationally named folders due to the 'my reference is coded with a different ID because it's from a different source' issue
