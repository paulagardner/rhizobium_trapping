#Critical
- [ ] change filepaths to reflect that 'workflow' files have been moved to the copied local repo on mesabi, 'rhizobium_trapping'

### Important
- [ ] remove 'shell scripts' folder in github to reflect that it no longer exists in local mesabi repo
- [ ] make a test plot from the R data 
- [ ] validate that workflow is functional from A -> Z (since around time of commit, files were reorganized)
##### Optional
- [ ] rearrange files for reference genome to be in a more convenient directory (they are buried in informationally named folders due to the 'my reference is coded with a different ID because it's from a different source' issue
